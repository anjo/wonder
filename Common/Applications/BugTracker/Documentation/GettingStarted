- configure your WebObjects.properties to point to the right DB (see ERXConfigurationManager)
- create the tables for bug.eomodeld, ERCore.eomodeld
- populate the reference data with populate.sql found in BTBusinessLogic
- one user account is created by default: admin/admin
   log in with it and create:
       - 1 or several users
       - 1 or several components
       - 1 or several releases

you should then be ready to file bugs
