* Log4j initialization

To get Log4j going, you will need something akin to the following in your WebObjects.properties (in your home directory under 5.1)


log4j.rootCategory=DEBUG, A1
log4j.appender.A1=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.A1.layout=er.extensions.ERXPatternLayout
log4j.appender.A1.layout.ConversionPattern=%-5p %d{HH:mm:ss} (%-20c:%L) %x -%m%n
log4j.category.er=INFO


* ERCrypto

using ERCrypto's methods will require a little bit of setup with JDK 1.3

this class requires that you have JCE (javax.crypto and the sun provider) installed
JCE is standard in the 1.4 JDK
for 1.3 you can find it at http://java.sun.com/products/jce/index-121.html
All,
you will have to put the 4 JCE jars in your extensions directory
(/Library/Java/Home/lib/ext on X) for ERExtensionsJava to build..
And edit /Library/Java/Home/lib/security/java.security, add the following line
security.provider.4=com.sun.crypto.provider.SunJCE
