<h1>ERMemoryAdaptor</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
ERMemoryAdaptor provides an implementation of an EOAdaptor that lives entirely in memory.  You
can think of ERMemoryAdaptor as a very simple in-memory database, sufficient for testing out
EOModels without the overhead of actually creating a database.  ERMemoryAdaptor is also ideal
for writing test cases, providing a resettable database that can execute tests very quickly.
While MockEditingContext provides some similar abilities, ERMemoryAdaptor lives at a lower level and
can "fool" a larger portion of the EOF stack, and also provides very simple support for transactions.
Because ERMemoryAdaptor is not a SQL-based in-memory database, you will not be able to execute
SQL qualifiers or custom SQL calls against it.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
To use ERMemoryAdaptor, add ERMemoryAdaptor.framework to your project dependencies, and change
the adaptor in Entity Modeler to "Memory".  Additionally, you may want to change your prototype
to EOMemoryPrototypes.
