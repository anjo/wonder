/**
 * The delayed non-null conditional is a way to provide a 
 * branching result from a rule resolution. The value of this 
 * assignment must be a dictionary that has the following keys: 
 *
 * @dictionarykey nonNullKeyPath key path to be tested for nullality
 *		off of the current D2W context.
 * @dictionarykey trueValue value to be returned if the key path is
 *		not null.
 * @dictionarykey falseValue value to be returned if the key path is
 *		null.
 *
 * Because this assignment is a delayed assignment the above condition 
 * will be evaluated everytime that the D2W fired rule cache resolves to
 * a rule of this class.</br>
 * <br/>
 * Example usage. Let's imagine that a User has a relationship called
 * <code>toOwnedHouse</code> this relationship is only set if the User is
 * a home owner. Now let's imagine that we have a page configuration 
 * for displaying information about a User. One of the propertyKeys
 * for this page configuration is 'residence' which is not an attribute 
 * or relationship off of the User object. Imagine that we have already built
 * a custom component for displaying the address of either an owned house or
 * a rented house for a given User. However we want the displayed name to be
 * either "Rented House" or "Owned House" depending on if the User is a home
 * owner. The usual approach would be to create two page configurations and
 * set the displayNameForProperty to be different for each of these page
 * configurations. However by using a DelayedNonNullConditionalAssignment
 * we will only have to use a single page configuration. Using this rule:
 *
 * pageConfguration = 'InspectUser' AND propertyKey = 'residence' =>
 *	displayNameForProperty =</br><code> 
 * {</br>
 *	nonNullKeyPath = "object.toOwnedHouse";</br>
 *	trueValue = "Owned House";</br>
 *	falseValue = "Rented House";</br>
 * }<br/></code>
