<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>The easiest way to get started is to watch the demo videos available from wocommunity.org and then run and play with the 
ERModernMoviesDemo application. ERModernMoviesDemo uses the ERMoviesLogic framework which has an embedded H2 database and shouldn't
require any configuration to get running.</p>
<p>The ERModernMoviesDemo can easily be copied and modified to use any business logic framework.</p>
<ul>
<li>Modify the NavigationMenu.plist to customize the main menu.</li>
<li>Duplicate and modify the MoviesNavigationController referenced by the session to support your Entities.</li>
<li>Modify the user.d2wmodel to support you Entities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using your own skin</h2>
<p>The CSS resource components in the look pages obtain the name of the framework that contains the css files from the 
er.modern.look.skinframework property. This makes creating your own skin as easy as duplicate the ERModernDefaultSkin framework 
and change the value of that property in it's Properties file to match it's new name.</p>
