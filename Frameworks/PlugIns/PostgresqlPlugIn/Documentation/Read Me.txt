Adds support for Postgres with WebObjects.

Currently, the Ant build is the only one that works.
Once built, the framework must be link to the 'Application Server'
target in you project.

If not found, sequences are generated on the fly or you can use the
EOMPlugin. Currently, if sequence with a different name is present, it
is ignored. The name of the used sequence is:
entity.primaryKeyRootName() + "_SEQ".

In EOModeler specify these parameters:
