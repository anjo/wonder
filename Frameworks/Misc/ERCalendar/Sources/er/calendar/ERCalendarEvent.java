     *		side makes it possible to guarantee uniqueness since no
     *		two hosts should be using the same domain name or IP
     *		address at the same time. Though other algorithms will
     *		work, it is recommended that the right hand side
     *		contain some domain identifier (either of the host
     *		itself or otherwise) such that the generator of the
     *		message identifier can guarantee the uniqueness of the left
