JRebel lets you do rapid development by allowing dynamic class modification and
reloading including method signature changes which are not support by Hot Code replace.
While JRebel will work with WebObjects on its own, the WOJRebel framework 
provides some additional functionality to make it more WO friendly. 
Specifically these additions include:
  o Flushing KVC caches when a class is modified
  o Clearing ClassNotFound results from the class cache
  o Clearing the component definition cache when a WOComponent is modified
  o Adding WOLips IDE Project support to WO 5.3 (already in WO 5.4)

Firstly you must be using JRebel, it can be obtained from www.zeroturnaround.com.

Next follow the instructions here since JRebel is integrated into current release of WOLips
and you might not need to include this framework at all.
