ERPDFGeneration provides both a utility class and a wrapper component for generating
PDF documents from XHTML markup. Two PDF generation engines are currently supported, 
FlyingSaucer (xhtmlrenderer) [1] and Useful Java Application Components (UJAC) [2],
however additional parser based engines like FOP could be added fairly easily. 
This is still experimental and the API may change as it evolves. You should test
thoroughly before using this in production.
