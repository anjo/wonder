JavaRebel lets you do rapid development by allowing dynamic class modification and
reloading including method signature changes which are not support by Hot Code replace.
While JavaRebel will work with WebObjects on its own, the WOJavaRebel framework 
provides some additional functionality to make it more WO friendly. 
Specifically these additions include:
  o Flushing KVC caches when a class is modified
  o Clearing ClassNotFound results from the class cache
  o Clearing the component definition cache when a WOComponent is modified
  o Adding WOLips IDE Project support to WO 5.3 (already in WO 5.4)

Firstly you must be using JavaRebel, it can be obtained from www.zeroturnaround.com.

To use it add the following Java VM arguments to your launch configuration:
    -noverify -javaagent:<pathtojar>/javarebel.jar

Next you must add the WOJavaRebel framework to the application's classpath.
The easiest way to do this is to simply add it as a regular WebObjects framework.
