The ExcelGenerator framework makes it easy to publish your reports into 
Excels native file format. For each table on a page a new sheet is 
generated in a workbook.

Styles can be either set in-line or via two dictionaries that 
contain the style definitions and fonts.

You can currently either:

- create an (XML compatible) content stream and give it to 
  EGSimpleTableParser, then call data() and do what you want with it.
- wrap your page in EGWrapper and return your it. If you set the "fileName" 
  binding, then the returned page will be saved on your client computer 
  under the given name.

TODO:
- flesh out EGWorkbook, EGSheet, EGRow and EGCell, so you can also generate your
  directly, without needing to parse a <table>

Have fun and please subscribe to wonder-dics@sourceforge.net.
