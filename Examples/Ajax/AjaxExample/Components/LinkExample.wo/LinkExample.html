For any of the Ajax components that provide onSuccess, onComplete, etc, it is important to understand that
the value of the binding should be a javascript function REFERENCE, not a call to a javascript function.  If you
have a function "function testFunction() { alert('hi') }", you should not make your binding:
<code>
onComplete = "testFunction()";
</code>
rather you should make it:
<code>
onComplete = "testFunction";
</code>
In the first case, testFunction will be called IMMEDIATELY upon evaluation of the request and its return value will be
passed to to the onComplete event callback.  In the second case, the testFunction itself will be used for the onComplete
callback. Similarly, if you wanted to alert('hi') in-place, your onComplete value would be "function() { alert('hi'); }"
rather than just "alert('hi')".

        <webobject name = "ReplaceLink">Replace Contents with replaceID binding</webobject>
        <div id = "ExampleReplacementArea">
        This area will be replaced when you click "Replace Contents".
        </div>
        <p/>
If you use an AjaxUpdateLink with replaceID, it is fundamentally different than updating an AjaxUpdateContainer.
In the case of an AjaxUpdateContainer, the update container component behaves exactly like a normal stateful component 
in a non-Ajax page except that it supports replacing its contents with a background Ajax call.
<p/>
With the replaceID binding, you are simply targeting the WOActionResults of your AjaxUpdateLink to write into an arbitrary div 
on the page.  ReplaceID updates do NOT behave nicely with component actions.  They are intended to give you a broader
freedom in updating areas of a page in exchange for not supporting component actions.  For instance, with AjaxUpdateContainer,
you must anticipate the area of the page that will be updated and wrap it in an update container (so that it has a known 
place in the component hierarchy).  With the replaceID binding, there is no such restriction.  If you attempt to use a 
component action inside of this area, it will result in an immediate backtrack exception.  People will die.  Only use 
direct actions.

If component actions are what you desire, check out the Update Examples -- there are lots of cool things you can do with them.
