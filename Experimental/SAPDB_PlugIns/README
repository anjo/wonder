EOF SAPDB PlugIns
----------------------------------

WARNING !!!!

    Not tested enough - should be considered alpha.
    
    Things that should work:
    - primary key generation
    - creating tables, foreign keys and primary key support
    
    SapDB JDBC driver required: 7.4.00.04c (earlier versions had bug that prevented NSTImestamp values from working properly)

		Things that surely DO NOT work:
		- BLOB values
