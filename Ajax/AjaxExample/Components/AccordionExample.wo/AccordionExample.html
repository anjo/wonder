From the Rico Accordion example: "The content div for each panel should not be styled to 
have borders, margins, or padding. When padding/margin is required, nest another DIV inside 
the content div and style it accordingly. Also, the panel content should not grow beyond the 
panelHeight attribute of the configuration parameter. On Firefox/Mac the scrollbar for an 
overflow area will cause the scrollbar to always be visible--even when the panel is collapsed. 
You can resolve this by setting the visibility of the contents when the panel starts to 
collapse or expand."
