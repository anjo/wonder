ERExtensions

  to the respective Utilities. There's more to do in this venue, but 
  it should be done before the release.

Updating from 1.0
-----------------

Due to the sheer number of changes, this can not be a binary compatible release, 
although we tried to break as few things as possible.

- if you use embedded property level components (ERDList+ERDInspect), you should contact the list.
- if you use the Page templates in ERD2W (not ERNeutralLook) you will have to check
  your app thoroughly. 
- if you use sections, you should convert them from 
  "('Some Section', (someKey, someOtherKey))" to
  "('(someSection)', someKey, someOtherKey)" and let the localizer handle it.
- if you use the current localized template, the delimiter has changed from "@" to "@@" to 
  allow for @count and the like. The old one should still work, but spews out a warning.
- ERD2W is not compatible with the WebServiceAssistant and JavaClient. Both use custom
  D2W model subclasses. Do not use them together in one application.
