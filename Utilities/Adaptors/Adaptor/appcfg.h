/*
 * Macros to check out/in or lock/unlock app or instance array elements.
 * Checking out an instance or app provides shared, read only access to the structure,
 * and prevents other threads from making changes. Locking an instance or app provides
 * exclusive access to the structure, allowing changes.
 * The following conventions are observed to avoid deadlocks:
 * 1) No thread may check out or lock more than one instance at a time.
 * 2) No thread may check out or lock more than one app at a time.
 * 3) A thread with an instance checked out or locked may not check out or lock an app.
 * (Some app settings are copied to the instance struct for this reason.)
 * 4) An instance or app which is checked out must be checked in before it can be locked.
 * 5) An instance or app which is locked must be unlocked before it can be checked out.
 * Note that a thread witn an app checked out or locked is allowed to check out or lock an instance.
 *
 * The checkout operations return WOApp * and WOInstance *, whereas the lock
 * operations return _WOApp * and _WOInstance *. The former are typedef-ed const so
 * the compiler can help keep track of whether access is read only or read/write.
 *
 * A successful checkout or lock returns a pointer to the structure, and must be followed
 * by a corresponding checkin or unlock. It is expected that there will be a fair amount
 * of contention for these resources on a heavily loaded site, so they should not be held
 * longer than necessary. A lock or checkout can theoretically fail, in which case they
 * return NULL. In this case there should be no corresponding call to checkin or unlock.
 * A typical usage might be something like:
 * inst = ac_checkoutInstance(instHandle);
 * if (inst) {
 *    ... do something with inst ...
 *    ac_checkinInstance(instHandle);
 * }
