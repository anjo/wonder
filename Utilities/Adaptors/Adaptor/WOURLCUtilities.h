/*
 *    The utilities defined in this file help with the manipulation of WOF dynamic URLs.
 *    WOF dynamic URLs are composed of the following components:
 *        <APPLICATION-NUMBER>: The instance number of the URL's application.
 *        <APPLICATION-NAME>: The name of the application the URL refers to.
 *        <REQUEST-HANDLER-KEY>: The key of the request handler that should handle the request
 *        <REQUEST-HANDLER-PATH>: The information specific to this request handler - not parsed.
 *        <QUERY-STRING>: What is after the question mark.
 *        <WEBOBJECTS-VERSION>: A string identifying the version of WebObjects run by the URL's application.
 *        <PREFIX>: A server-specific string.
 *    These utilitie allow parsing of a WOF dynamic URL string for its components and generation of a
 *    WOF dynamic URL string from its components.  Because the format of a WOF dynamic URL may change over
 *    time, these utilities should always be used to access a WOF dynamic URL's components or to generate
 *    a WOF dynamic URL (i.e. no assumptions should be made about a WOF dynamic URL's format). Once inside
 *    the request handler specified by the key, it is up to the developer of the request handler to handle
 *    the decoding of the url and the format generation on the following pages, if needed.
