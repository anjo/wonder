/*
 *	Load Balancing:  this defines the generic interface to any load
 *	balancing algorithm.  Enough calls are available to give the load
 *	balancer info about the progress of the request & how it turned out.
 *
 *	The goal of load balancing is generally better (shorter) response times
 *	for URL requests; implementations can only guess at ways to achieve
 *	that.  Strategies mostly strive to evenly distribute sequential 
 *	requests to the pool of apps.
 *
 *	Note that for applications which store session state in the app,
 *	load balancing is performed for the 1st request only.
 *
 *	To add a load balancing module, implement the functions defined below
 *	and add the module to 'loadbalancing.c'.  See random.c for an example.
