When you receive the IPN, you have to echo it back to PayPal in a form post with "&cmd=_notify-validate" appended to the original.

They will respond with a short answer with only the word "VALID" or "INVALID" in the content text.
	 
If it's valid you have to check that the transaction isn't a duplicate.  If it's not and its payment_status is "completed," you can then save and process it however you like.
