<H1>WebObjects Server Adaptor Installation</H1>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
WebObjects provides several alternative adaptors, depending upon your WebServer and platform.
There are plugin-style adaptors (Apache, ISAPI, NSAPI) and a generic CGI executable.
We generally recommend using a server plugin for deployment in preference to the generic CGI adaptor
simply because they offer significant performance benefits and more control over
load-balancing/scheduling.
For more detail on the pros and cons see the WebObjects Adaptors reference in WOInfoCenter.
</P>
<P>
The 4.5.1 adaptors are an evolution of the 4.0 adaptors.
Among the features which differentiate them from the 4.0 WebObjects adaptor:
</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Many aspects runtime configurable, including:
    <UL>
      <LI>Load balancing strategy</LI>
      <LI>App-adaptor communication transport</LI>
      <LI>Socket Timeouts</LI>
      <LI>App URL version (supports 3.5, 4.0 and 4.5 app URLs)</LI>
      <LI>Error redirect URLs</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI>Scheduling improvements: added Instance load based scheduling</LI>
  <LI>XML based configuration file format</LI>
  <LI>Simpler, automatic configuration for multiple web servers - no more config files</LI>
  <LI>Radically improved performance</LI>
</UL>

In order to get the optimum performance and availability from your deployed web apps, 
you may want to experiment with the various settings for connection pools, timeouts and
buffer sizes.

<H3>Installation and Configuration</H3>
<P>
This document describes only the general aspects of installing and configuring the WebObjects WebServer adaptors. For information on installing specific adaptors, 
see the installation files for 
<A HREF="CGI/Installation.html">CGI</A>, 
<A HREF="Apache/Installation.html">Apache</A>,
<A HREF="IIS/Installation.html">Microsoft ISAPI</A>,
<A HREF="NSAPI/Installation.html">Netscape NSAPI</A>.
</P>
<H4>CGI</H4>
The CGI adaptor should be installed automatically in the correct location when you
installed WebObjects 5.0 on a platform that is supported. If you are installing on a separate WebServer you need to 
copy the CGI executable into the cgi-bin or Scripts directory on your WebServer(s).
You may need to enable CGI programs for that directory if you haven't already done so.
How this is done varies from server to server so please consult your WebServer 
administration documentation.

<H4>Server Plugin Adaptors</H4>
For supported platforms, we have a list of server plugin adaptors that will be installed together with WebObjects. Depending on the platform, you will need to configure the installed adaptor or move it to the correct directory as well.

<P> 
It is possible to build other plugin adaptors for a platform (for example, NSAPI for Windows) but it will be unsupported by Apple. Please consult the adaptor-specific installation files and your webserver adminstration documentation.
