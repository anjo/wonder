FastCGI WebObjects adaptor
===========================


Legal
-------------
Code is derived from the original CGI adaptor, thus APSL 1.2 applies.


About FastCGI
-------------
Dont be misguided by the 'CGI' acronym - FastCGI is ultra fast, and ultra cool. The basic idea is to multiplex everyting
(requests, responses, error info, management records) between the http server and web application over one bidirectional
communication channel, socket to be exact. Check it out at http://www.fastcgi.com!


Purpose
-------------
- Be able to make changes relatively safely without resorting to CGI
- Allow WO serving from unsupported servers, like Zeus
- Chances are that this will be the first adaptor usable with Apache 2.0


Possibilities
-------------
Teach WO the FCGI protocol and strip the adaptor completely. It might be faster than mod_WebObjects.


Bugs
-------------
Same problems as with plain CGI adaptor, for example WOFileUpload
Not really a bug, but tested only on Linux.
