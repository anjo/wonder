/*
 * This module contains functions for managing a chunk of shared memory.
 * The memory is mapped into each running adaptor, and is backed by a
 * file in the filesystem. (See the documentation for mmap().)
 *
 * This implementation provides support for naming regions of shared memory.
 * The shared memory region has special usage semantics. Each
 * allocation has both a size and a name. When an allocation is attempted
 * a search is performed for the name. If it is found, that region is
 * returned, possibly with a size that was different from what was
 * requested. If there has never been a region with that particular
 * name allocated, it will be created with the requested size if
 * there is enough room.
 *
 * This module also provides functions for implementing an array of
 * generic elements in a region of shared memory, including both
 * shared and exclusive locking functions.
 */


/*
 * Initialize shared memory using the given file. The file must
 * be able to be opened for both reading and writing. Returns 0 on
 * success, nonzero on error. If a nonzero value is returned, shared
 * memory access is disabled and all allocations will fall back to
 * using WOMALLOC().
 * If the file does not exist, it will be created. memsize specifies
 * a minimum file size. The file will be expanded to be at least this
 * size by appending zeros.

 * size is elementSize, a pointer to the region is returned

 * is returned in *elementCount. If a region named regionName
 * is found and the element size differs, NULL is returned.
 * If there is no existing region named regionName, a new
 * region is created with that name, its element size is
 * set to elementSize, and enough storage is allocated to
 * hold *elementCount elements. The new region is returned,
 * or if there is no room to create the region NULL is returned.
 * Once a region is created there is no way to destroy/deallocate it
 * short of deleting the file which backs the shared memory and
 * restarting all processes which use the memory.
 * The returned pointer will not change for the lifetime of the process,
 * so it may be kept to avoid repeating the region lookup.
