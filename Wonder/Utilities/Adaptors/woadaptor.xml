<!-- Reference:

Attributes:
    retries=NUMBER
        specifies the number of times to try a request against an application (trying several instances) before returning an error.
    scheduler=["random"|"roundrobin"|"loadaverage"]
        specifies which load balancing algorithm to use to select an application instance
    dormant=NUMBER
        if an instance doesn't respond, do not try to contact it for this many seconds
    protocol="http"
        the RPC protocol to use to the application.  Currently only HTTP is supported.
    redir=URL
        if an error occurs during request processing, return a redirect (302) HTTP response with URL as the location
    sendTimeout=NUMBER
        timeout, in seconds, before reporting a failed send() to an instance
    recvTimeout=NUMBER
        timeout, in seconds, before reporting a failed recv() from an instance
    cnctTimeout=NUMBER
        timeout, in seconds, before reporting a failed connect() to an instance
    poolsize=NUMBER
        number of persistent connections to maintain with an instance
    urlVersion=["3"|"4"]
        the WebObjects version to use for URL parsing and formatting

<application>
    Required attribute: "name".
    Attribute values here specify load balancing behaviour and application scope settings.

<instance>:    
    Required attributes: id, port, host
    Attribute values here specify instance scope settings.
