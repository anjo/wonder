<H2>CGI adaptor interface for WebObjects</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
This is a generic CGI adaptor designed to be usable with all webservers that supports CGI. There is a performance disadvantage in using the CGI version; you are encouraged to use a server plugin adaptor whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
To install this adaptor, copy the file <CODE>WebObjects</CODE> (or <CODE>WebObjects.exe</CODE> on Windows) to your web server's cgi-bin or scripts directory. This is done for you if you install WebObjects on to the system with a web server installed.
</P>
<H3>Security Note</H3>
Please note that the WOAdaptorInfo (configuration information listing) and application listing functionality are enabled by default with the CGI adaptor for the convenience of developers. These should be disabled for deployment. To disable these features, you need to set the following environment variables to &quot;disabled&quot; so that the CGI program can determine the functions are switched off, or, alternatively, rebuild the CGI adaptor with a code change to turn off the feature (see WebObjects.c for how to do this).
<UL><LI>WO_ADAPTOR_INFO_USERNAME</LI><LI>WO_ADAPTOR_INFO_PASSWORD</LI></UL>

<H3>Adaptor Configuration</H3>
The CGI adaptor configuration is modified by using environment variables. You must consult your WebServer documentation to understand how to create and pass environment settings on to a CGI program.

<UL>
  <LI>WO_CONFIG_URL
    <P>
    For all platform except Windows, the CGI adaptor uses a memory-mapped state file and does not need to contact wotaskd for each request. For Windows NT/2000, by default, the CGI adaptor contacts the instance of wotaskd on the local host to locate applications. Since this is expensive for a CGI program (it must do it every time), for deployment you would normally want to use a different mechanism - either a static file on the webserver machines, or a static URL. To change this, set the WO_CONFIG_URL environment variable. Examples:
	</P>
    <UL>
      <LI>Static file: file:///Local/Library/WebObjects/Configuration/WebObjects.xml</LI>
      <LI>wotaskd URL list: http://woserv1:1085,http://woserv2:1085,http://woserv2:1085</LI>
      <LI>Static URL: http://www.company.com/private/woappconfig.xml</LI>
    </UL>
    <P>
    For the latter case you'll need to make sure your web server is configured to send text/xml as the MIME type for .xml files.
	</P>
  </LI>
</UL>

<H3>Debugging using the CGI adaptor</H3>
<P>
There is a good reason to use the CGI adaptor: to exercise the underlying request handler and debug any customizations you may have made to the source code.  Since all input to any CGI program is provided in the environment variables and stdin, the WebObjects CGI program can be conveniently run under a debugger.
</P>
<P>To do this, set the following environment variables (examples using /bin/sh):</P>
<UL>
	<LI><CODE>REQUEST_METHOD=GET;export REQUEST_METHOD</CODE></LI>
	<LI><CODE>SERVER_PROTOCOL=HTTP/1.0;export SERVER_PROTOCOL</CODE></LI>
	<LI><CODE>QUERY_STRING=\?foo=bar;export QUERY_STRING</CODE></LI>
	<LI><CODE>SCRIPT_NAME=/cgi-bin/WebObjects;export SCRIPT_NAME</CODE></LI>
	<LI><CODE>PATH_INFO=/MyApps/MyCoolApp;export PATH_INFO</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<P>
If you want to include form data, set a <CODE>CONTENT_LENGTH</CODE> header and type the form as stdin.
</P>
<P>
Another solution is to edit the provided <CODE>TestCGI.sh</CODE> or <CODE>Env.csh</CODE> file to suit your needs and execute it.
</P>

<H3>Mac OS X Server Issues</H3>
<P>
If there are problems executing the CGI adaptor on MacOS X Server, make sure that the "WebObjects" CGI executable is located in /Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/, is owned by root:admin, and is executable by everyone. If MacOS X Server is running on an HFS filesystem, stop the WebServer, remove the /tmp/WOAdaptorState file, "touch WebObjects", and restart the WebServer. You may have to repeat this process (i.e. "touch WebObjects" and restart) after every boot or reboot for the WebServer to notice it.
