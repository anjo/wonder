HTML (HEX Codes) Color Palette


NOTES

HTML (HEX codes) is a MacOS X color palette that contains all of the HTML "web-safe" colors.  I made it because I the stock color palette doesn't have this functionality and I got tired of typing in the color values by hand.

If I can save others a bit of headache, then I'm happy to have helped.


INSTALLATION

Just copy the HTML (HEX codes).clr file to one of the following directories:

/Library/Colors/           <-- (for all local users)
~/Library/Colors/          <-- (for yourself)
/Network/Library/Colors/   <-- (for everyone on your network)


TIPS

If it doesn't show up in the Apple Colors palette after you've copied the HTML (HEX codes).clr file to one of the above directories, click on the "Color Palettes" (3rd button to the left) button.  HTML (HEX codes) should appear in the "Palette..." drop-down list.  If it doesn't, you can try 2 approaches.

1.  Quit your application, relaunch it, and try again.
2.  Using the List dropdown at the bottom of the list, select "Open..." and navigate to the directory where you copied the HTML (HEX codes).clr file.  Choose it, and it should load for you.


Caveat

I don't know if this works with Carbon apps.  You can try it, and let me know.  All the ones I tried use a different color picker...
