- put display thresholds in the conf file

- add an option or tool to 'preprocess' the logfile and remove all the irrelevant lines (like css, image requests, etc.)

- add a warning at the beginning if the logfile is bigger than a certain number of lines. The tool was tested for files up to certain size (see README)

- program cache takes a lot of RAM, probably this could be optimized (haven't looked into this due to lack of time).

- add more documentation

- maybe refactor ReportGenerator, e.g. to delegate respective report type generation to other classes?

- microsecond detector:
  - maybe replace by config file setting (yes/no)

- get to know commonly used ruby documentation format and apply it to existing inline comments. There's also probably a way to generate online docs.
