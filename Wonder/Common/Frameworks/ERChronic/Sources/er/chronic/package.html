<p>
ERChronic is a nearly direct port to Java of the <a href = "http://chronic.rubyforge.org/">Ruby Chronic library</a>.  Currently neither Ruby
Chronic nor ERChronic are internationalized, though extending the parsers to support additional languages is probably not terribly complicated (most
are just a set of regular expressions, etc).
</p>

<p>
Using Chronic is very simple:
</p>

<pre>
Span result = Chronic.parse("two weeks from today");
</pre>

<p>
A Span object can represent either a point in time or a range of times.  If a Span represents a point in time, result.isSingularity() will return true.
Chronic.parse also has a variant that takes an Options object, which allows control of the parser behavior (specifying what "now" is, controlling
how ERChronic handles ambiguous times, and several other settings).

Other examples of parseable strings:
<ul>
	<li>tomorrow</li>
	<li>next monday at 7:30</li>
	<li>may 15th</li>
	<li>tomorrow morning</li>
	<li>yesterday at 9:00</li>
	<li>tomorrow at 11pm</li>
	<li>wednesday last week</li>
</ul>
</p>
