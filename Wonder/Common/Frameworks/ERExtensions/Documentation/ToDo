ToDo list:

Things to Remove:
ERXSuccess - Silly component that just has the string Sucess in it, no real value add.  Was used at NS for our ping action
    to see if the apps were alive.
ERXNoHelpAvailable - Another silly component, not sure why this one was put in extensions, simply displays a No Help Available 
    message
ERXRenameObjects - Pretty specific component, I don't think it will be used at all by any one.
ERXLongResponsePage - This was before the days of WO 5 with the java version, not needed now that the java version is in 
    WOExtensions
ERXDisplayHTML - Silly component that just has a string in it with escapeHTML set to false, no real value add in my opinion.
ERXCheckedIfEqual - Just an ERXEqualConditional with a checkbox from the JavaDirectToWeb framework in the conditional, I
    don't see a value add here.
ERXAddObjectWithName - Don't even have the WOComponent for this guy. Again pretty specific component that isn't very reusable.
ERXKeyValueCoding - Not needed now with WO 5. The one extra utility method can be moved to a utility class.
Either ERXAutoClosePage or ERXJSCloseWindow - These components do the exact same thing. Could rename one of them to:
    ERXJSAutoCloseWindow

Stuff to correct:

Misc Components
ERXRadioButtonMatrix: Need to expose ERXTable api as well as add sorting like ERXCheckboxMatrix.
ERXCheckboxMatrix: Need to localize Sellect All buttons, need to correct JS to only select checkboxes in the current
    group, not all checkboxes in the current form.
ERXQueryRecentDates: Should be stateless, generalized (has hardcoded dates at this point) and localized
ERXImageTabPanel: Bad image naming conventions, should be generalized.
ERXEditURL: Should be abel to specify the url default via a binding
ERXDisplayDataAsString: Escape HTML should be an optional binding
ERXDirectActionHyperlink, ERXDirectActionImage: Add api files
ERXLinkRandomizer: Should be renamed ERXJSLinkRandomizer, be moved to the Javascript group and use a 
    ERXOncePerRequestConditional. 
ERXBatchNavigationBar: Should use ERXOptionalForms adding a binding to not use a form, then we can get rid of 
    ERXBatchNavigationBarInForm 

Utilities
ERXNumberFormatter: Should provide api to set ignored characters
ERXSimpleTemplateParser: Should get rid of bogus anothObject api, either use an Enumeration or an NSArray.
ERXTimestampUtility: Should move all functionality into ERXTimestampUtilities, then remove
ERXRetainer: Should actually implement retain counts
ERXSimpleHTMLFormatter: Tab width should be configurable.
ERXNavigation: Should most likely be removed, as well as all the references in ERXSession.

JS Components
ERXJSConfirmPanel: Should use a WOComponentContent and expose all of the bindings usually found on WOHyperlink.
ERXJSPopupSelector: Get rid of hardcoded form index in js.
ERXCheckCookies: Should be renamed to ERXJSCookiesConditional
ERXFormForTarget: Renamed to ERXJSFormForTarget. Should remove the targetDictionary and break all of the keys out into bindings.
    Should also be stateless. 

log4j
ERXPatternLayout: Should add WOPort or better yet a special flag for WO %W and then specify all of the other stuff in a {}, i.e. WOPort, app name, instance id ...

Misc stuff
Create ERXEOFUtilities: move all eof related utilities from ERXExtensions and ERXUtilities into this class.

Move utility methods dealing with strings and arrays from ERXExtensions into correct utility classes.

Test if ERXSharedEOLoader is still needed, if not let's remove it. I believe the reason for this class was fixed with WO 5.0

Remove all WOExtension backports and have all classes extend the ones found in ERWOExtensions.
