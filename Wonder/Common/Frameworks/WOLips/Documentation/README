To fully utilize WOLips.framework, you must add support for click-to-open and you must provide 
a prototype.js implementation.  Note that click-to-open support is expensive, because it has to dig around
your component HTML quite a bit, so you will take a performance hit in development to have it enabled.

1) If your components extends ERXComponent, all you need to do is set:

	er.component.clickToOpen=true

in your Properties file.

If you do not use ERXComponent and instead have a custom component base class, you must add 
clickToOpen support to your components on your own. You should ONLY have clickToOpen execute in your 
component if you are in development mode.  To include it into your component base class, you can use 
the sample implementation from ERXComponent:

	@Override
	public void appendToResponse(WOResponse response, WOContext context) {
		...
		boolean clickToOpenEnabled = ...; 
		ERXClickToOpenSupport.preProcessResponse(response, context, clickToOpenEnabled);
		super.appendToResponse(response, context);
		ERXClickToOpenSupport.postProcessResponse(getClass(), response, context, clickToOpenEnabled);
		...
	}

Note that when clickToOpenEnabled is false, the ERXClickToOpenSupport methods are no-ops.

2) If your Application.java class does not extend ERXApplication, add a method like this:

private Boolean isDevelopmentMode;
public boolean developmentMode() {
    if (isDevelopmentMode == null) {
    	isDevelopmentMode = new Boolean(ERXProperties.booleanForKey("developmentMode", false));
    }
    return isDevelopmentMode.booleanValue();
}

And add this to the launch arguments:
-DdevelopmentMode=true

3) You must be using a recent version of WOLips that supports the WOLips Server.  In
your WOLips preferences, you must enable the WOLips Server, set the port number and the communication
password.  Turning on the WOLips Server requires a restart of WOLips.

In your application preferences, you can then set:

	wolips.host=localhost
	wolips.port=9485
	wolips.password=yourpassword
	
Only 'wolips.password' is strictly required as long as you use the default port of 9485.

4) WOLips.framework needs a prototype.js.  If you are using Ajax framework, you don't need to do
anything, because it will default to use Ajax.framework's prototype.js.  However, if you are not,
you must set (as an example):

	wolips.prototype.framework=app
	wolips.prototype.fileName=prototype.js

5) In your page wrapper, add a <wo:WOLToolBar/> component, and you're good to go.  Look in the lower
left hand corner of the browser window for the link.
