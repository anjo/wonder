Welcome to the ER Frameworks!

Introduction

Requirements
	These frameworks work with both WO 5.1 and WO 5.2.
	
The Frameworks and Dependencies

ERDirectToWeb - This framework is a great extension of the DirectToWeb framework.  
See the ERD2WClassList.html file in the Documentation diectory for a short one sentence description of the classes.  This framework depends on both ERExtensions and ERJars.


Installation Instructions

Everything should be pretty staight forward.  Just be aware of the above dependencies.  The only action that needs to be taken before running an
application with the frameworks linked in is to set one default:  ERConfigurationPath to point to a Java properties configuration file.  This is the file that is used to initialize the log4j system.  A sample configuration has been included in the file SampleConfiguration.config.
