<h1>Migrations</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
One of the annoying aspects of having a deployed application is   
maintaining, organizing, and executing database revisions.  Rails has   
the concept of "migrations" for declaring ordered sets of database   
changes, and their basic approach was the original inspiration for   
Project Wonder's migrations along with Christian Pekeler's work on
database versioning.  However, it's fairly common in WO/EOF   
to have multiple frameworks that each have their own models and their   
own needs for database versioning, and this can introduce a lot of   
complexity that the previous work didn't directly address that
ERXMigrations attempt to resolve in a consistent way.
</p> 

<p>
There are several aspects of database versioning and EOF that need to   
be considered.  One major issue to contend with in EOF is that your   
mapping between your code and the database is declared in your   
EOModel.  You generally only have a SINGLE version of your EOModel   
(and class files), though -- the latest one.  So if you are running a   
migration from version 5 to version 10, in general you can't touch   
EO's at all, because the model that loads is very likely out of sync   
with the current state of the database.  More importantly, even if   
you know that at the moment the model is in sync, you have to   
consider FUTURE state.  If you're writing the migration for version 5   
and talking to an EO, that EO might not exist in version 25, and if   
you ever have to migrate from, say, 3 to 25, you would pass through 5   
and it would explode because you're talking about version 5 EO's with   
a version 25 model.  Wonder migrations don't yet address this   
specific aspect, though I do have some ideas about it.  In the   
meantime, as a general rule, you are not allowed to talk EO's/ 
EOModels/etc in the midst of a migration -- you need to (right now)   
talk straight SQL <em>Note: There is now also an API called
ERXMigrationDatabse/ERXMigrationTable/ERXMigrationColumn that provides
a simplified API on top of EOSynchroniationFactory that allows you to
avoid using SQL for many common cases.</em>.  There is a special hook that I'll mention later   
that can be used in very limited instances to do some EO work, but   
just don't think about it for now.  Rails actually has a simpler API   
for doing common transformations that Wonder might pickup some   
equivalent for (something like EOSynchronizationFactory, but not   
insane). 
</p>
<p>
Another aspect to consider is framework interdependencies.  This   
turns out to appear deceptively simple, but is actually quite nasty.   
When I first set out, I thought I would just look at your framework   
dependencies, migrate each up to their latest version and be done.   
But of course, nothing is ever easy.  In reality, framework   
dependencies weave in and out of versions.  To migrate my app from   
version 10 to version 15, version 11 might depend on CoreFramework 5   
and version 12 might depend on CoreFramework 8 and version 15 might   
depend on CoreFramework 13.  If you apply the same issues from above,   
you realize that you have to expect things in the right order,   
because tables and columns might not exist at the right time if you   
don't.  So in Wonder migrations, each migration step can declare a   
list of other model versions that it depends on, and Wonder will   
build the graph and figure out the order in which to execute them all   
so that you end up in a happy state.  Wonder always ends up migrating   
every model to the latest version by the end.  The route it takes to   
get there may weave through versions across models, but once all the   
intermodel dependencies are met and executed, it then proceeds to   
migrate each model up to the latest revision.

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
So lets look at an example and some code: 
</p>
<h3>HotNew.app's HotNewModel:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>v0 = depends on AccountingModel v2, CoreModel v3</li> 
  <li>v1 = depends on AccountingModel v5</li> 
   <li>v2 = depends on AccountingModel v8, CoreModel v5</li>
</ul>
  
<h3>Accounting.framework's AccountingModel:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>v0 = depends on CoreModel v0</li> 
	<li>v1</li>
	<li>v2 = depends on CoreModel v2</li> 
	<li>v3</li>
	<li>v4</li>
	<li>v5</li> 
	<li>v6</li>
	<li>v7 = depends on CoreModel v5</li> 
	<li>v8</li> 
	<li>v9</li>
</ul>
	
<h3>Core.framework's CoreModel:</h3>
<ul> 
	<li>v0</li> 
	<li>v1</li> 
	<li>v2</li>
	<li>v3</li>
	<li>v4</li>
	<li>v5</li>
	<li>v6</li>
</ul>

<p>
Would get executed as (I regret now choosing so many versions :) ):
</p>

<h3>Flattened Dependencies</h3>
<ol> 
	<li>CoreModel v0</li> 
	<li>AccountingModel v0</li> 
	<li>CoreModel v1</li>
	<li>CoreModel v2</li>
	<li>AccountingModel v1</li> 
	<li>AccountingModel v2</li>
	<li>CoreModel v3</li>
	<li>HotNewModel v0</li>
	<li>AccountingModel v3</li>
	<li>AccountingModel v4</li>
	<li>AccountingModel v5</li>
	<li>HotNewModel v1</li>
	<li>AccountingModel v4</li>
	<li>AccountingModel v5</li>
	<li>AccountingModel v6</li>
	<li>CoreModel v4</li>
	<li>CoreModel v5</li>
	<li>AccountingModel v7</li>
	<li>AccountingModel v8</li>
	<li>HotNewModel v2</li>
	<li>CoreModel v6</li>
	<li>AccountingModel v9</li>
</ol>

<p>
The "dependency flattener" is not magic -- it is definitely possible   
for you to build some crazy broken dependencies.  In practice, I have   
not run into a case where this happens to me with multiple   
interdependent models, but just be aware of this. 
</p>
<p>
So now that we see the order that it executes, how do we set this up? 
</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>
In my Properties file, I define the following: 
</p>
<pre>
er.migration.migrateAtStartup=true 
er.migration.createTablesIfNecessary=true 
HotNewModel.MigrationClassPrefix=com.mdimension.hotnew.migration.HotNewModel 
</pre>

<h3>er.migration.migrateAtStartup</h3>
<p>
<em>er.migration.migrateAtStartup</em> tells Wonder to automatically execute   
migrations when the app starts ... I generally leave this on, but   
this WILL modify your database, so you should be mindful when you   
deploy it into production that you've tested your migrations   
properly.  Before I deploy to production, I always clone the   
production database and run the migrations in testing, and I always   
make a backup of the production database before starting with a new   
migration.  Better safe than sorry. 
</p>

<h3>er.migration.createTablesIfNecessary</h3>
<p>
Migrations track the current   
versions of your models in a table named "_DBUpdater".
createTablesIfNecessary tells wonder to just autogenerate these   
tables if they don't exist.  If you don't run as a database user with   
create permissions, you will want to turn this off.  When you attempt   
to start, it will tell you the create table statement to execute when   
it fails to run.  You should also be careful of this setting if you
run with multiple instances the first time you startup your app, 
because this table is used for locking across multiple instances. 
</p>

<h3>[modelName].MigrationClassPrefix</h3>
<p>
Last but not least, the <em>MigrationClassPrefix</em>.  In this case, we have   
a model named HotNewModel.eomodeld, and therefore we have a   
<em>HotNewModel.MigrationClassPrefix</em>.  Wonder migrations take this value   
and append incrementing numbers to the name   
(com.mdimension.hotnew.migration.HotNewModel5,   
com.mdimension.hotnew.migration.HotNewModel6, etc).  If you don't   
declare this value, migrations will look for a packageless class with   
the same name as the model.  In the above example, each framework   
would declare the migration class prefixes for its own models in the   
framework Properties file, so the top level app Properties would only   
define the app's model. 
</p>

<p>See the JavaDocs for ERXMigrator and ERXJDBCMigrationLock for more 
properties controlling the migration process.</p>

<h2>Java</h2>
<p>
So what does a migration look like, you ask? 
</p>
<pre>
package com.mdimension.hotnew.migration; 

public class HotNewModel2 implements IERXMigration { 
   public NSArray<ERXModelVersion> modelDependencies() { 
     return new NSArray<ERXModelVersion>(new ERXModelVersion[] { new ERXModelVersion("AccountingModel", 8), new ERXModelVersion("CoreModel", 5) }); 
   } 

   public void upgrade(EOEditingContext editingContext, EOAdaptorChannel channel, EOModel model) throws Throwable { 
     ERXJDBCUtilities.executeUpdateScriptFromResourceNamed(channel, "HotNewModel2-" + ERXJDBCUtilities.databaseProductName(channel) + ".sql", null); 
     ERXJDBCUtilities.executeUpdate(channel, "update Person set name = 'Mike' where age = 28"); 
   }

   public void downgrade(EOEditingContext editingContext, EOAdaptorChannel channel, EOModel model) throws Throwable { 
     // whatever it takes to invert those 
   } 
} 
</pre>
<p>
I end up using:
</p>
<pre> 
     ERXJDBCUtilities.executeUpdateScriptFromResourceNamed(channel, "HotNewModel2-" + ERXJDBCUtilities.databaseProductName(channel) + ".sql", null); 
</pre>
<p>
pretty frequently, so that will probably end up with a shorter syntax   
one of these days, but this ends up loading HotNewModel2-FrontBase.sql 
or HotNewModel2-Postgresql.sql from the Resources   
folder, depending on the connection dictionary that is executing them   
at the time.  The second line is generally database independent, so I   
can just execute it in place -- use your best judgement on this one.   
If your migration doesn't have explicit dependencies (i.e. a previous   
version specified its dependencies, and you're fine with the same),   
you can just return NSArray.EmptyArray from modelDependencies.
<em>Note: A core API now exists for this by having your migration
extend the ERXMigration base class.</em> 
</p>
<p>
I'm generally too lazy to write downgrade, and honestly Wonder   
doesn't even have the code to order the dependencies to EXECUTE a   
downgrade, and some migrations are nearly impossible to invert   
anyway, so write it if it makes you feel better, but it's not getting   
executed just yet, so don't kill yourself :) 
</p>

<h2>Transactions</h2>
<p>
Each migration executes in a transaction, and the version table   
update occurs within that transaction.  Depending on your database   
and the operations you perform, sometimes it's not feasible to   
execute the migration in a single transaction.  You can either split   
the migrations then into two migrations, or you can manually commit   
the channel connection if you have to, but know that if you are   
manually committing, you are sacrificing rollback-ability.  By the   
time you get to production, you really don't want migrations to fail,   
though, so I recommend testing first ... It's just less pain that   
deploy-and-pray. 
</p>

<h2>Introducing Migrations into Existing Systems</h2>
<p>
The migrations counter starts at zero, so YourModel0 is the first   
migration that will run.  Migration zero is the one that will   
generally have your first create table statements in it.  So if you   
are wanting to use migrations on an application that is already   
deployed with an existing database, you need to tell the migration   
system "I'm already at version 1 (or version x), so don't recreate   
the tables -- just pretend you've already done that."  You can use   
<em>YourModelName.InitialMigrationVersion=2</em> (for example) in your   
properties file to specify this.  I generally specify these ONLY in   
the Application properties file (and not in a framework Properties   
file), because a framework might be reused in multiple applications,   
and any NEW deployment would actually need to start at 0 (rather than   
the application-specific "v2"). 
</p>

<h2>Never Say Never: EOModel Access</h2>
<p>
So what about that reference I made to "never touch EO's ..... OK   
SOMETIMES you can touch EO's". 
</p>
<p>
It turns out that the REAL restriction for touching EO's is that you   
can ONLY touch them once all the migrations have run -- not DURING.   
For instance, your migration zero might create a bunch of tables, but   
it's also very common to want to create a bunch of initial data.   
This is really handy to do with EO's.  But because of the   
restrictions with versioning, it can't happen as part of the   
migration process itself.  Instead, there is a mechanism that will   
let you "queue up" EO operations to perform when your migrations are   
done.  The HUGE catch here is that these do NOT participate in the   
database version tracking.  That means if a "post operation" fails,   
it's gone and will not reexecute (because migrations believe it is   
already at the correct version).  I may deal with this in a better   
way in future versions by tracking post op version separately, but   
for now, just don't let them fail :) 
</p>
<p>
To perform a "post op", your migration can implement   
IERXPostMigration instead of IERXMigration, and this adds the   
additional method: 
</p>
<pre>
   public void postUpgrade(EOEditingContext editingContext, EOModel model) throws Throwable; 
</pre>
<p>
So as migrations are running in dependency order, ERXMigrator keeps   
track of "Post Migrations", which will themselves execute in   
dependency order, but only after a completely successful model   
migration.  So by the time IERXPostMigrations begin to run, all of   
your EOModels will match the database tables.  postUpgrades also each   
run in a transaction.  editingContext.saveChanges() will be called   
for you after postUpgrade is done. 
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
So that's it!  Migrations.  I know this is a lot to soak in ... It   
looks daunting.  The theory behind it is WAY more complicated than   
just using them, though.  Once you get the hang of declaring your   
dependencies, you will find this to be a life saver.  My technique   
now is that I migrate ALL the time.  Meaning, I write migrations for   
use in development.  I never modify my database through the database   
tools -- only migrations.  This way, I make sure that when I deploy,   
all revisions were properly recorded.  The biggest annoyance at the   
moment is that you have to do the SQL yourself, but to be honest, you   
were already doing this before unless you were doing all but the   
simplest of database revisions (i.e. schema update with no model   
interdependencies and no data revisions). 
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned before, we may introduce a simpler database   
transformation API for things like adding columns, removing columns,   
add/remove "not null", etc. It will likely be some blend of EOModel   
API (which currently requires too much manual setup in code to do on   
the fly) and EOSynchronizationFactory (which is just way to tricky to   
use for normal things).  <em>Note: There is now an API for this.  See
ERXMigrationDatabase, ERXMigrationTable, and ERXMigrationColumn</em>.
</p>
<p>
It's also possible that Entity Modeler may   
provide mechanisms to track changes and tag revisions at some point,   
though EOModel format does not capture quite enough metadata to   
really be able to automate revisions, and some revisions could NEVER   
be done automatically (where you have to munge data), so I don't know   
where exactly this will go.  There's also the possibility of   
providing an API to more easily load in specific model versions   
(where you might have MyModel5.eomodelrev, etc) during migrations so   
you can actually do EO-y things, though this gets REALLY tricky,   
since you are talking to two versions at once in a migration. 
</p>
<p>
Go forth and migrate.
