<h2>JavaWOExtensions</h2>
<p>JavaWOExtensions was included with the introduction of Wonder. </p>
<p>It's supplied in the /System tree and in the /Developer/Examples section. </p>
<p>Way back when they were different (and buggy) and Apple wasn't exactly doing marvels in fixing them, so we decided it'd be good to have this in *one* (here) place were all the fixes could go. Since then, the /System stuff *is* actually fixed, so there shouldn't be that much of a difference. Anyway, you decide this when you link your app... That being said, when you link to ERExtensions, the WOSortOrder, WOToOneRelationship and WOToManyRelationship get changed to use the ones in ERX!</p>
