<h1>JavaRESTAdaptor (Experimental Still!)</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
JavaRESTAdaptor is an EOF adaptor implementation on top of a RESTful web service, similar to ActiveResource
in Rails.  Currently JavaRESTAdaptor is read-only, but should be sufficient for consuming RESTful services.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
The usage of JavaRESTAdaptor is best explained in an example.  This example is adapted from an ActiveResource
tutorial, but it provides several examples of common techniques. The service we're going to communicate with
is a Beast installation.  Beast is a simple Rails forum application.  We'll use http://beast.caboo.se as
our example service provider.
</p>

<h2>Creating the Model</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Create a Wonder project.</li>
	<li>Create an EOModel (of any name) and choose "None" from the list of adaptors 
in the wizard.</li>
	<li>In the default database config (assuming you're using a recent WOLips), select the 
prototype "EORESTPrototypes" and select the Adaptor "REST".</li>
	<li>In the URL, enter "http://beast.caboo.se" and leave the username and password 
blank (currently JavaRESTAdaptor does not support HTTP authentication).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Creating Entites</h2>
<p>
Beast provides four entities that we want to interact with: Forum, Topic, Post, User.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Create an entity named Forum.</li>
	<li>
		The "table name" of Forum will tell JavaRESTAdaptor the URL extensions and XML tags that can be used to 
		access the entity.  In the case of Forum, the XML tag name comes in two variants -- a singular and a plural
		form.  For the Forum entity, set the table name to "forum,forums".
		<p>
			Table name for JavaRESTAdaptor comes in  several forms:
			<ul>
				<li>If you do not set a table name, JavaRESTAdaptor will simply use the entity name as the singular form,
				and use ERXLocalizer to generate a plural form.</li>
				<li>If you only set a single value (i.e. "forum"), the adaptor will use that as the singular form and 
				use ERXLocalizer to generate a plural form.</li>
				<li>If you specify two values (i.e. "forum,forums"), the adaptor will use the first value as the singular
				form and the second value as the plural form.</li>
				<li>Additionally, as you will see later, you can specify a set of possibly URL prefixes to use to access 
				the entity.  When you do not specify a URL prefix (as in our Forum example), the adaptor will assume that
				it can go to /[plural form].xml and /[plural form]/[id].xml to retrieve objects of this entity type.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>We need to determine the attributes of Forum, so open http://beast.caboo.se/forums.xml in your browser and
	view the source. ActiveRecord (or more importantly Ruby) can one-up us here, because they automatically 
	determine the attributes of records based on queries to the service.  We ultimately want to generate Java code,
	so we need to create an EOModel with attributes.</li>
	<li>Forum has the attributes: description, description-html, id, name, position, posts-count, and topics-count.
	Create attributes in your entity with the names converted to camelCase (description-html becomes descriptionHtml,
	etc).  For each attribute, select a representative prototype, and set the external name to be the original name
	from the XML.  For example, descriptionHtml is a "varcharLarge" prototype (we could pick one with a smaller 
	restriction if we want to limit the values) and its external name is "description-html".  postsCount is an
	"intNumber" and its external name is "posts-count".  Do this for the rest of the attributes of Forum.</li>
	<li>In Beast, forums contain topics, so let's create the Topic entity.  Topics present an interesting issue
	with modeling, because Beast does not allow you to select topics from the top level, rather you can only
	select topics through a Forum.  For example, there is no /topics/1.xml there is only /forums/1/topics/1.xml.
	This oddity does cause some problems for EOF, because EOF expects to be able to fetch objects
	with only a primary key.  JavaRESTAdaptor provides the ability to model fetching these entities, but you
	should be careful of places where EOF may cause faults for individual objects.  You may find it safer to
	model relationships to entities of this type in code with fetch specs, or if you're using the Wonder eogen 
	templates, traverse these kind of relationships with forum.topics(null, true), which will force a refetch of
	the entities.</li>
	<li>Request http://beast.caboo.se/forums/1/topics.xml to see an example of what topics look like.  Follow the
	same procedure as for Forum, creating attributes from the XML.  For dates, use the prototype "dateTime".  For
	foreign keys, use the attribute "id" and mark them as non-class attributes.</li>
	<li>Now to address the URL issue for Topics.  Because there is no /topics.xml, we need to tell JavaRESTAdaptor
	how to find topic objects.  Edit the Topic entity and set the table name to "/forums/[forumID]/topics,topic,topics".
	This says that to fetch a topic, you must use the URL "/forums/[forumID]/topics" where forumID is a variable 
	that corresponds to the Topic attribute of the same name.  Any time a fetch is performed on a Topic, a forumID
	must appear in the qualifier or an exception will be thrown from JavaRESTAdaptor.  When traversing a to-many 
	relationship from a Forum to a Topic, this happens automatically inside of EOF.  However, if you are trying to
	fetch a particular topic, you must provide its forum in your qualifier to prevent an error.</li>
	<li>Now create the Post entity.  Posts are similar to Topics in that you cannot access them from the top level
	of the service, but they can be accessed in several different ways.  It turns out that you can get posts for
	a user, for a forum, or for a topic (which requires a forum). JavaRESTAdaptor allows you to model these methods
	as alternative URLs in the table name by separating the URLs with a pipe.  For instance, the table name for
	Post is "/users/[userID]/posts|/forums/[forumID]/posts|/forums/[forumID]/topics/[topicID]/posts,post,posts".  I
	admit this is ugly, and ideally these definitions would be defined on the relationships instead of the entity,
	but unfortunately at the adaptor level, the EORelationship that was used to fetch the objects is long gone. What
	ERREST does in this case is that it looks at the qualifier provided and finds the URL that matches the most 
	variables from your qualifier keys and uses that as the fetching URL.  For instance, if your qualifier only 
	has a userID in it, the /users/[userID]/posts URL will be used.  However, if you qualifier has a forumID and
	a topicID in it, the /forums/[forumID]/topics/[topicID]/posts will be used.  An exception will be thrown if
	a suitable URL cannot be found given the provided qualifier.</li>
	<li>Lastly, create your User entity.  Nothing fancy here, and top-level fetches are allowed, so take a look
	at http://beast.caboo.se/users.xml to create your attributes, and use the table name "user,users" on this
	entity.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>
You have created all of the entities for reading information from Beast.  You can now create the
relationships between these entities.  For entities that can be fetched from the top level, or when modeling
relationships that will provide enough context for the fetch, relationships can be modeled just like a 
normal eomodel.
</p>
<p>
For instance, from post.user() is a completely normal to-one relationship because User can be 
fetched from the top level, and post will provide the "id" necessary to execute the fetch.  Similarly, 
forum.topics() is a normal to-many relationship, because while Topic does not have a topic level fetch URL,
traversing the relationship from Forum will provide the "forumID" necessary to complete the fetch.
</p>
<p>
The "problem child" relationships are, for instance, topic.posts().  Traversing the posts relationship on Topic
will only provide a topicID.  Unfortunately Posts requires a topicID AND a forumID.  It turns out that this
can be modeled by putting both topicID and forumID in the joins of the to-many relationship definition.  The
downside of this is that it will not be symmetric with the other side of the relationship, and will not be
updated automatically when write ability is added to JavaRESTAdaptor.  The other problem is that, while this
technique works on to-many relationships, it does not work on to-one relationships.  EOF does not allow
a to-one relationship to be defined with a join on anything expect a primary key attribute.
</p>
In this  situation, you will need to construct the relationship using a fetch spec, and not using normal 
relationship definitions in the model.  Your fetch spec will work just like a normal fetch spec, but you must
provide all variables necessary to complete a fetch.  As an example, if you want to fetch a particular topic,
you must fetch it like:
</p>
<p>
Topic singleTopic = Topic.fetchRequiredTopic(editingContext, Topic.FORUM.eq(aForum).and(ERXQ.equals("id", 633)));
</p>
<p>
or
</p>
<p>
aForum.topics(ERXQ.equals("id", 633), true)
</p>
<p>
Note that JavaRESTAdaptor allows fetching on non-class attributes.
</p>

<h2>Fetching Notes</h2>
<p>
When fetching against the remote service, only topic level EOKeyValueQualifiers, EOAndQualifiers, and 
EOOrQualifiers with a single entry will be processed for constructing the remote URL.  Complex qualifiers
can be constructed, but they will be evaluated in-memory against the most restrictive URL that could
be constructed given your qualifier attributes.
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

  System.out.println("Application.Application:   " + post.createdAt());
}

Post randomPost = topicPosts.lastObject();
System.out.println("Application.Application: Fetching the topic for a post (this will break if topic is not already fetched)");
System.out.println("Application.Application:   " + randomPost.topic().title());

System.out.println("Application.Application: Fetch author of post");
User postedByUser = randomPost.user();
System.out.println("Application.Application:   " + postedByUser.displayName());

System.out.println("Application.Application: Fetching posts by author");
NSArray<Post> userPosts = postedByUser.posts();
for (Post post : userPosts) {
  System.out.println("Application.Application:   " + post.createdAt());
}
