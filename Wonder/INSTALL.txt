Installation Instructions
=========================

Binary installation should be straightforward: 

- put the frameworks in /Library/Frameworks 
- put the application in /Library/WebObjects/Applications
- put the WebServerReources in /Library/WebServer/Documents/WebObjects

Compiling Wonder distribution from scratch
==========================================
If you like to build everything by yourself, the following setup is required:
- create a Folder ~/Roots
- an installation of Ant (either via fink or manually) in your path.
- The presence of servlet.jar in your classpath. 
  The easiest way to do this under Mac OS X is to drop the jar in 
  ~/Library/Java/Extensions or /Library/Java/Extensions (requires root privileges, though). 
  On Mac OS X, you can find a copy under /Developer/Java/J2EE/jakarta-servletapi-4/lib/
- A properties file named wobuild.properties under your ~/Library (on Mac OS X, don't 
  know on Windows), which will contains something like this:

==== START wobuild.properties ====

wo.dir.root=/ 
wo.woroot=/
wo.dir.user.home.library.frameworks=/User/yourname/Library/Frameworks
wo.dir.local=/
wo.wosystemroot=/System
wo.dir.library=/System/Library
wo.dir.user.home.library=/User/yourname/Library
wo.dir.local.library=/Library
wo.dir.library.frameworks=/System/Library/Frameworks
wo.dir.local.library.frameworks=/Library/Frameworks
wo.wolocalroot=/
wo.dir.system=/System

==== END wobuild.properties ====

- then call up

  sudo ant all

or

 ant clean compile; sudo ant install

at the top-level folder. 

Also, please take a look at the 'GettingStarted' document.


Installing Jikes
================

You don't really need this, but jikes compiles much faster than javac.

Windows
-------
1) Copy jikesSpec.plist to $(NEXT_ROOT)/Developer/Makefiles/Resources.
2) (Windows) Copy jikes.bat to $(NEXT_ROOT)/Local/Library/Executables.
3) Download and unpack Jikes from IBM.
     http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/
4) Copy jikes.exe to $(NEXT_ROOT)/Local/Library/Executables.
5) Make sure X:\Apple\Local\Library\Executables is in your PATH.
   (Where X is the drive WebObjects is installed on)
  
Mac OS X Server
---------------
1) Follow the instructions on
  http://www.xanthippe.ping.de/jikes/
  
  *** To use Jikes, select IBM Jikes as your compiler in the Project Inspector.
  
Mac OS X
--------  
Mac OS X includes jikes in the Developer Tools installation CD. 
You should be all set if you already have WebObjects installed.
