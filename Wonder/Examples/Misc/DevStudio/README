Building:
=========
I never tried anything else but Ant!

 cd DevStudio
 ant -f Build/build.xml
 
be sure to have the latest woproject.jar in /usr/local/ant/lib!

TODO:
=====

- everything not nailed down should move to a framework
- add EOJenerator classes
- add saving
- add file:// url handling
- add prefs saving
- renaming (DS prefix?)
- add DAs for EOModeler, RuleEditor
- add IFRAMEs for RuleEditor

Naming:
=======
- everything with ER* is a candidate for the ER* frameworks

Main:
=====
- shows how to instantiate the other components

RuleEditor:
===========
- ERD2WRuleEditorModel replaces every "className = D2WRule" with ERD2WExtendedRule that adds setters and a userInfo. Upon saving, this should be changed again to D2WRule and streamed out.

ERD2WRuleEditorModel:
=====================
- replaces every "className = D2WRule" with ERD2WExtendedRule that adds setters and a userInfo. Upon saving, this should be changed again to D2WRule and streamed out.

ERD2WExtendedRule:
=====================
- adds setters and a userInfo to the rules. Upon saving, this should be changed again to D2WRule and streamed out.

EOModeler:
==========
- you need some EOPrototypes in a model in the model group
- should be refactored a bit:)

JavaBrowser:
============
- relative URLs don't work when browsing
- should use installed docs as files, but: IE on OSX uses file://localhost/Developer/....whereas Mozilla uses file://NameOfDisk/Developer/???


JavaDocViewer:
==============
- doesn't work yet.
- the plan is to split up JavaDocs into the actual parts and make that browsable

Jode:
=====
- just a bunch of proxies to get KVC
- reads its settings via the localizer

Application,Session:
====================
-Nothing of value

StringHolder:
=============
- docs and code go there

ERXIFrame:
==========
- can be used inline, ie: you can put some stuff in WOBuilder into it and it gets rendered in an IFRAME

ERXQualifierEditor:
===================
- quick and dirty display for EOQualifiers (like the ones in Apple's EOModeler and RuleEditor)

DirectAction:
=============
- support for DAs for JavaBrowser (bookmarks)


Node:
=====
- patches a few things in JTidy
