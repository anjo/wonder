GENERAL
-------
This is an EOModeler bundle that provides tighter integration with PostgreSQL. It provides the appropriate customizations for SQL generation, but does not do schema synchronization. You should link PostgresqlPlugin.framework into your project in order to use the sequence-based primary key support generated by this bundle.

This project needs to be built and copied into /Developer/EOMBundles. EOModeler will not recognize it if it's in ~/Developer/EOMBundles.


LICENSE
-------
This plugin is provided under the GNU LPGL. Take a look at the LICENCE file for details.
