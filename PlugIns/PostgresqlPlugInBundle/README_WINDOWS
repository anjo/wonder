README for PostgresqlPlugInBundle v1.2 Windows
----------------------------------------------


AUTHOR

Hermann Roscheisen (hroescheisen@medienwerft.de) [Windows porting only]


INSTALLATION
------------
On Windows the bundle needs to be installed into $NEXT_ROOT/Developer/EOMBundles. (Build with "install" to do this automatically).


MODIFICATIONS FOR WINDOWS
-------------------------
I only have changed the three import statements from
  import com.apple.cocoa.foundation.*;
to
  import com.apple.yellow.foundation.*;
in order to suite the windows environment.

Since there is no #ifdef in Java, you must go to the source files PostgresqlPlugIn.java, PostgresqlExpression.java, and PostgresqlSynchronizationFactory.java and edit the imports by hand before compiling on Windows.

IMPORTANT HINT
--------------
If you encounter SQL expressions ending with "or or or " you need the latest JDBC 1 driver. Version jdbc7.0-1.1.jar delivered with Suse Linux has this bug. It is fixed in jdbc7.1-1.1.jar. (http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html)
