IMPORTANT HINT
--------------
If you encounter SQL expressions ending with "or or or " you need the latest JDBC 1 driver. Version jdbc7.0-1.1.jar delivered with Suse Linux has this bug. It is fixed in jdbc7.1-1.1.jar. (http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html)


USING BOOLEANS WITH POSTGRESQL
------------------------------
It is possible to use PostgreSQL booleans with WebObjects.

- the external type should be bool
- the value class should be NSNumber
- the value type should be 'c'
- the instance variable in your EO can be boolean or Boolean

So EOModeler doesn't think you have some kind of custom data type, you should specify the internal type to be Integer using the inspector, and then change the value type to 'c'
